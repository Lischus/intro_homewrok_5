        Welcome to my high-scale art portfolio/shop! This is the place to go in
        order to both marvel at my high-quality artwork as well as have the
        chance to bid on some of my creations! List up top are several buyers
        who I can assure you have probably bought some art of mine! Please don't
        verify this with them, it's kept under wraps in order to try and keep
        away art thieves but trust me they've more than likely bought my work
        and you would be foolish not to join in while the getting's good! Listed
        below will be whichever pieces I feel are worth showing off, some
        information and history on the piece, whether it's up for grabs or not,
        and other helpful information for you to boast about if you're fortunate
        enough to take a piece home with you!
